<p align="justify">The Chemical Engineering Student Society (ChESS) is a student run council representing students pursuing an undergraduate degree offered by the department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Ottawa. For the 2016-2017 academic year I served as the Vice President of Financial Affairs. </p>

<p align="justify">Through this role I was responsible for: planning a balanced budget, preparing an audit for review by the Engineering Student Society, and aiding the executive with engineering endowment fund applications. Working with ChESS allowed me to network with industry professionals locally to host plant tours, career workshops, and plan networking events for students.</p>
