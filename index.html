<p>Hi! I’m Tushar Joshi, a <i>soon to be</i> chemical engineer, and a person who is passionate about new technology and entrepreneurship. With the hunger to learn, get involved and ‘hustle’, I often involve myself with opportunities that differ from my peers. I am inspired by challenging the norm, and utilizing my analytical skills to solve problems.</p>
